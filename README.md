Docker image based on Debian Etch for the amd64 architecture. This distro has been deprecated for quite some time, and its usage is not recommended for security reasons. Still you may use it in isolated environment.
This image is based on growchie/etch with the additions of the basic developer tools.
It exports /root/build directory for easy file exchange with the host system.
